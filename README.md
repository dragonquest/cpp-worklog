# Worklog 

Worklog is a small console utility that allows you to write down the work you did. The purpose of it is that you can manage your free time projects.

Example

```bash
 worklog list
1         2017-05-20  Virtual Machine in C#           [csharp, virtualmachine]
2         2017-05-20  Laravel ToDo List App           [laravel, php]
3         2017-05-20  Hex Dump in assembler           [assembler]
```

## Features

The following commands are supported:

```bash
Available commands:
  broken              lists all invalid logs
  edit                edit a work log. An additional id parameter is required.
  help                shows this help
  init                initializes a worklog space
  list                lists all logs
  new                 add a new work log
  rep                 repeats a command. Example: ./tool rep 1,3,7 view ["separator string"] (shows 1, 3 & 7 in a loop)
  rm                  removes a work log. An additional id parameter is required.
  search              search the work logs by a filter: tag:php -tag:javascript
  tag                 add, remove or list tags
  view                view a work log. An additional id parameter is required.
  yearly              shows a breakdown report by year
```

## Requirements

* [bazel build system](http://bazel.build)
* Clang version 4.0.1
* OSX (I have compiled & tested it under OSX but it also should work under any linux system)

## How to compile

In order to compile it execute the following command: 

```
$ bazel build :worklog
```
(and you will find the binary in ```./bazel-bin/worklog```.


## Demo

### Initializing a worklog repo:

First we need to initialize a worklog repository (sort of like git works):

```bash
$ worklog init
```
This will create a .worklog directory with all the meta data needed. The logs are stored in .worklog/logs/*

### Adding a worklog entry:

Type in the following:

```bash
$ worklog new
```

It will automatically launch your default editor ($EDITOR) and feeds it with a template, like:

```bash
date=2017-06-24
tags=tag1, tag2

Title here

Description here
```

It fills in the date automatically but you must now edit the tags, title and description. 

__NOTE__: The empty line between header area and title, and between title and description is important.

(for demo purposes I have added a few valid and invalid work log entries)

### Listing the work logs:

```bash
$ worklog list
7         2017-06-24  Title here                      [tag1, tag2]
2         2017-05-20  Laravel ToDo List App           [laravel, php]
3         2017-05-20  Hex Dump in assembler           [assembler]
1         2014-05-20  Virtual Machine in C#           [csharp, virtualmachine]
```

### Listing the work logs by year:

```bash
$ worklog yearly
2017:
7         2017-06-24  Title here                      [tag1, tag2]
2         2017-05-20  Laravel ToDo List App           [laravel, php]
3         2017-05-20  Hex Dump in assembler           [assembler]

2014:
1         2014-05-20  Virtual Machine in C#           [csharp, virtualmachine]
```

### Listing the broken work logs:

It might be possible that you save a invalid work log by accident (and they don't appear when entering 'worklog list'). In order to list them type the following:

```bash
$ worklog broken
4         1970-01-01  broken                          []
5         1970-01-01  broken version 2                []
```
Based on the output you can see that the date is wrong. In order to fix that we can type in ```worklog edit 4``` and ```worklog edit 5```.

### Searching the work logs:

Work log provides functionality to search all the work logs by the tag and also title. Example:

```bash
$ worklog search tag:php
2         2017-05-20  Laravel ToDo List App           [laravel, php]
```

For more information please check out ```worklog help```.

## Notes on this version

In my initial version I had the boost dependencies included in third_party/boost/* but Github doesn't allow it to push such a big repository. For that reason I have changed all the bazel dependencies & updates the references to ```https://github.com/nelhage/rules_boost```. The git repository containing all the dependencies are stored in BitBucket (https://bitbucket.org/andin/cpp-worklog). If you want access to it then please drop me an email.


## Development status

It was a free time project in order to learn C++ so I don't know if I will continue to develop on worklog further.
